# Daily Challenges programs
There are three different programs, two of which are available in both Java and Python. The output for the Java versions is produced in the console, while the output for the Python versions is produced in a separate text file.
1) A program that translates Breakbar's txt file into wikitext.

    1.1. Java: "EntryPointDailyChallenges.java". Edit the values of the 3 final static String variables at the top.

    1.2. Python: "EntryPointDailyChallenges.py". Edit the values of the 3 variables at the top then enter the year you want the wikitext for in the console.

2) A program that gives the probability of each modifier appearing on a certain mission and gives a list of modifiers removed from certain missions. The Java version has two different implementations: one using enums and EnumMaps ("EntryPointProbabilities.java") and one that avoids enums and uses HashMaps instead of EnumMaps ("EntryPointProbabilitiesNoEnums.java"). The Python version is "EntryPointProbabilities.py".

3) A program that translates the output of EntryPointProbabilities.java into wikitext. It is "EntryPointProbabilitiesWikitext.java". I currently do not plan on making a Python version of it.

# Black Dawn date checker
This program is known to bug out on online IDEs, so instead I recommend using either Eclipse for the Java version (https://eclipseide.org/) or Anaconda for the Python version (https://www.anaconda.com/download/success).

1) Java: "EntryPointBlackDawnDateChecker.java". I recommend using Eclipse to run this.
2) Python: "EntryPointBlackDawnDateChecker.py". I recommend opening Anaconda Navigator (included in the Anaconda Distribution) and using Spyder to run this.
