There are two different programs, both available in both Java and Python. The output for the Java versions is produced in the console, while the output for the Python versions is produced in a separate text file.
1) A program that translates Breakbar's txt file into wikitext.

    1.1. Java: Edit the values of the 3 final static String variables at the top.

    1.2. Python: Edit the values of the 3 variables at the top then enter the year you want the wikitext for in the console.

2) A program that gives the probability of each modifier appearing on a certain mission and gives a list of modifiers removed from certain missions. The Java version has two different implementations: one using enums and EnumMaps and one that avoids enums and uses HashMaps instead of EnumMaps.
