1) A program that translates Breakbar's txt file into wikitext.

    1.1. Java: Edit the values of the 3 final static String variables at the top then the output is produced in the console.

    1.2. Python: Edit the values of the 3 variables at the top then enter the year you want the wikitext for in the console. The output is produced in a separate text file.

2) A program that gives the probability of each modifier appearing on a certain mission and gives a list of modifiers removed from certain missions. There's two different implementatios of this program: one using enums and EnumMaps and one that avoids enums and uses HashMaps instead of EnumMaps.

I'm currently in the process of making Python versions for readers more experienced with Python than with Java. These versions may or may not be identical due to limitations present in the development environments.
